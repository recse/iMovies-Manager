# What is iMovies Manager? 📱

This is an Android application that works as a personal manager or film library. 

Through the themoviedb API, it collects all the information on movies and series and displays them in the main menu, where the user can mark them as favorites, in addition to obtaining a small synopsis of it.


It has a registration and login (both in the form and through the Google account), through which the user can create as many profiles as they want. 

Thanks to the integration with Firebase, it has its own tools such as Realtime Database (where the database of user preferences is stored), as well as control and test execution tools (Crashlytics, Power Monitoring, Performance ... .).

```
#git clone https://github.com/recse/iMovies-Manager.git
```

## How it works? ⚙️
On the home screen you will need to register to create a user profile. 

Once logged in, you will find the main view, where you can scroll horizontally through the different sections (trends, action or comedy), as well as click on each movie or series to see its details in depth and be able to mark them as favorites. 

Above the search bar you will have a contextual menu, which is displayed on the left of the screen, where you can scroll through the different menus (movies, series, favorites, log out). 

You also have a search bar where you can find any movie or series listed in themoviedb.
